Witness the pulse of life across our planet! From season to season and year to year, Earthâ€™s vegetation is constantly changing, providing critical information on plant species, crops, seasonal effects, pollen sources, and changes in plant phenology (the relationship between seasonal changes and climate and biological phenomena in plants).
